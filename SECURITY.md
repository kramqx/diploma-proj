## 🐛 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in Doxynix, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

**Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.** Publicly disclosing a vulnerability can put the entire community at risk.

### How to report:

1.  **Email us:** Send a detailed description of the vulnerability to **[security@mail.doxynix.space]**.
2.  **Include details:** Please include as much information as possible:
    *   Type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, SQLi, IDOR).
    *   Steps to reproduce the issue (POC).
    *   Screenshots or video evidence.
    *   Any relevant code snippets.

### Our Response Policy:

*   We aim to acknowledge your report within **48 hours**.
*   We will keep you updated on the progress of the fix.
*   Once fixed, we will publicly acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## 🚫 Out of Scope

The following types of reports are generally **not** considered valid vulnerabilities for this project:

*   **DDoS/DoS attacks** or any attacks that disrupt the service availability.
*   **Social Engineering** (phishing) of employees or users.
*   **Self-XSS** (attacks that require the user to paste code into their own console).
*   Missing security headers (unless they lead to a direct exploit).
*   Automated scanner reports without a valid proof of concept.

## ⚖️ Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:
*   Report vulnerabilities in good faith.
*   Do not access or modify user data without permission.
*   Do not disrupt our services.
*   Give us reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure.
